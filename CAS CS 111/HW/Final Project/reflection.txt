I choose Sherlock Holmes and Arsene Lupin for my source bodies. Sherlock Holmes and Arsene Lupin are both well-known detective novel from Europe. For the new texts, I choose three different novels, life of pi, Moby Dick, and Treasure Island. Those three novels have distinct stories and they are both little buts relates as a themed adventure. The result of comparing the three texts to Sherlock Holmes and Arsene Lupin is that they are all similar to the Sherlock Holmes. so the three authors of the mysteries books are more likely to close to the author of the Sherlock Holmes.

I think my text classification program works moderately or maybe could be a little bit better. I compared three different texts to the Sherlock Holmes and Arsene Lupin, and the result was closer to Sherlock Holmes. The result could have been improved better if my stems() function return the correct loots. If my stem function was working better than I could have had the accurate results of the stems of the word and it would lead to accurate results. Also, I used full book text for Arsene Lupin, but I only used just the one chapter of the Sherlock Holmes. This could lead to the result was more close to Sherlock Holmes since the text classification is based on how many same letter repeated from the number of the texts from the whole book. Because Sherlock has lesser words in the text, even if Arsene Lupin and Sherlock Holmes both do not have the works, The result is more lean to Sherlock Holmes. Next time I need to find similar lengths of the texts and improve the stem function.
