## Description
I create a simple webpage where users can type queries and retrieve documents from a predefined dataset. The task involves applying LSA to reduce the dimensionality of the document-term matrix and using cosine similarity to measure the relevance of documents to the user’s query.

The webpage MUST include the following functionality:

## Functionality
### 1. Document Retrieval:
Users can enter a text query.
The system returns the top 5 documents based on their similarity to the query.

### 2. Visualization:
Display a bar chart showing the cosine similarity of the top documents to the query.

### 3. User Interface:
Input field for the user to type their query.
A “Search” button to perform the document retrieval.
A results section displaying the top 5 documents with their similarity scores.
A bar chart that shows the cosine similarity of the top documents to the query.
