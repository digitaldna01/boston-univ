# Overview
In this competition, your task is to develop a predictive model to identify potentially fraudulent transactions using various machine learning algorithms. Fraud detection is a critical challenge in many industries, especially finance, where identifying fraudulent activities can save organizations from significant financial losses. By accurately predicting whether a transaction is fraudulent, institutions can take preventive measures to secure their operations.

# Problem Statement:
Given a dataset containing transaction information, such as user demographics, and transaction details, you will build a model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent. The goal is to create a binary classifier that can accurately predict a fraudulent transaction based on these features.

NOTE: You CANNOT use deep learning techniques, including neural networks.
